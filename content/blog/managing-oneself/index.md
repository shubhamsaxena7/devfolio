Most people think they know what they are good at. They are usually wrong.

**The only way to discover your strengths is through feedback analysis. Whenever you make a key decision or take a key action, write down what you expect will happen. Nine or 12 months later, compare the actual results with your expectations.**

- First and foremost, concentrate on your strengths. Put yourself where your strengths can produce results.
- Second, work on improving your strengths.
- Third, discover where your intellectual arrogance is causing disabling ignorance and overcome it.

Go to work on acquiring the skills and knowledge you need to fully realize your strengths.

Manners are the lubricating oil of an organization. It is a law of nature that two moving bodies in contact with each other create friction.

_It takes far more energy and work to improve from incompetence to mediocrity than it takes to improve from first-rate performance to excellence._

Like one’s strengths, how one performs is unique. It is a matter of personality. Whether personality be a matter of nature or nurture, it surely is formed long before a person goes to work. And how a person performs is a given, just as what a person is good at or not good at is a given.

Schools everywhere are organized on the assumption that there is only one right way to learn and that it is the same way for everybody.

- Am I a reader or a listener?
- How do I learn?
- Do I work well with people, or am I a loner? And if you do work well with people, you then must ask, In what relationship?
- Do I produce results as a decision maker or as an adviser?
- Do I perform well under stress, or do I need a highly structured and predictable environment?
- Do I work best in a big organization or a small one?

To work in an organization whose value system is unacceptable or incompatible with one’s own condemns a person both to frustration and to nonperformance.

**Successful careers are not planned. They develop when people are prepared for opportunities because they know their strengths, their method of work, and their values. Knowing where one belongs can transform an ordinary person—hardworking and competent but otherwise mediocre—into an outstanding performer.**

What should my contribution be? To answer it, you must address three distinct elements: What does the situation require? Given my strengths, my way of performing, and my values, how can I make the greatest contribution to what needs to be done? And finally, What results have to be achieved to make a difference?

Managing yourself requires taking responsibility for relationships. This has two parts.

1. The first is to accept the fact that other people are as much individuals as you yourself are. They perversely insist on behaving like human beings. This means that they too have their strengths; they too have their ways of getting things done; they too have their values. To be effective, therefore, you have to know the strengths, the performance modes, and the values of your coworkers.
2. The second part of relationship responsibility is taking responsibility for communication.

The failure to ask reflects human stupidity

Organizations are no longer built on force but on trust. The existence of trust between people does not necessarily mean that they like one another. It means that they understand one another. Taking responsibility for relationships is therefore an absolute necessity.

The second way to prepare for the second half of your life is to develop a parallel career.

There is one prerequisite for managing the second half of your life: You must begin long before you enter it.

There is another reason to develop a second major interest, and to develop it early. No one can expect to live very long without experiencing a serious setback in his or her life or work.
