## Economic Machinery

Three main forces that drive the economy

- Productivity Growth
- Short term debt cycle
- Long term debt cycle

## Transactions

- An economy is simply the sum of transactions that make it up
- Each transaction consists of a buyer exchanging money or credit for goods, services or financial assets

- Total spending = amount of money spent + amount of credit spent

## Market

- A market consist of all the buyers and all the sellers making transactions for the same thing
- An economoy consists of all the transactions in all of it's markets
- People, business, banks and governments all engage in transactions exchanging money and credit for good, services and financial assets

- The biggest buyer and seller is the government. It consist of two parts
  - Central government - collects taxes and spends money
  - Central bank - controls the amount of money and credit in the economy
- Central bank control the money and credit by influencing interest rate and printing money

## Credit

- The most important part of economy
- Lenders usually want to make their money into more money
- Borrowers usually want to buy something that they can't afford

_Credit can help both lenders and borrowers get what they want_

- Borrowers return principal + interest
- Credit is just the ouput of a transaction of money between lenders and borrowers
- As soon as credit is created, it turns into debt
- Debt is an asset to the lender and liability to the borrower
- When a borrower receives credit, he/she is able to increase their spending
- Since everything is a transaction, each person's spending is someone's income
- Increased income -> increased borrowing -> Increased spending. This leads to more increased borrowing. **_This self enforcing pattern leads to economic growth_**

## Cycles

- In a transaction, you have to give something to product something. The amount you get depends on how much you produce
- **productivity growth**
  - Productivity is the measure of _production efficiency_
  - Productivity growth refers to an increase in the value of outputs for a given level of inputs, over a given period of time
  - Productivity matters most in the long run, but credit matters most in the short run
  - Productivity doesn't fluctuate much in short run. You cannot grow your productivity overnight. Hence, it's not a big driver of economic swings
- Debt drives economic swings faster because it allows us to consume more than we produce when we acquire it and forces us to consume less than we produce when we pay it back
- Short term debt cycles swing about 5-8 years and long term debt cycles take about 70-100 years
